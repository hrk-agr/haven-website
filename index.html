        <h1>Haven is the Internet's anti-platform</h1>
        <p>
            The access to Internet is currently controlled by gatekeepers. This
            enables them to seek rent on the back of multiple businesses, often
            making more than what the businesses make. We believe in empowering
            businesses to break free from the constraints and dependencies
            imposed by these platforms. Say goodbye to excessive fees, opaque
            algorithms, and loss of control over your brand. No more being at
            the mercy of platforms dictating your every move.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the existing distribution of these platforms enables new
            customers to discover you, it is you who should directly control
            their subsequent interactions. <u>Haven empowers you to do this.</u>
        </p>
